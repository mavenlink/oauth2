# Change Log
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [unreleased]
- Set the response object on the access token on Client#get_token (@cpetschnig)

## [1.3.0] - 2016-12-28

- Add support for header-based authentication to the `Client` so it can be used across the library (@bjeanes)
- Default to header-based authentication when getting a token from an authorisation code (@maletor)
- Allow an `auth_scheme` (`:basic_auth` or `:request_body`) to be set on the client, defaulting to `:request_body` to maintain backwards compatibility (@maletor, @bjeanes)
- Handle `redirect_uri` according to the OAuth 2 spec, so it is passed on redirect and at the point of token exchange (@bjeanes)
- Refactor handling of encoding of error responses (@urkle)
- Avoid instantiating an `Error` if there is no error to raise (@urkle)
- Add support for Faraday 0.10 (@rhymes)

## [1.2.0] - 2016-07-01

- Properly handle encoding of error responses (so we don't blow up, for example, when Google's response includes a âˆž) (@Motoshi-Nishihira)
- Make a copy of the options hash in `AccessToken#from_hash` to avoid accidental mutations (@Linuus)
- Use `raise` rather than `fail` to throw exceptions (@sferik)

## [1.1.0] - 2016-01-30

- Various refactors (eliminating `Hash#merge!` usage in `AccessToken#refresh!`, use `yield` instead of `#call`, freezing mutable objects in constants, replacing constants with class variables) (@sferik)
- Add support for Rack 2, and bump various other dependencies (@sferik)
